# GRMHD Simulation Project on studying var(Te)
This project contains two parts: <br>
1. The data visualizations of variances of variables including electron temperature (Te), gas density ($`\rho`$), gas pressure ($`Pg`$), and magnetic field strength ($`B^{2}`$): see Te.ipynb, Te-longer-interval.ipynb,
   beta.ipynb, var.ipynb <br> See `On Funnel Wall Variability.pptx` for a quick overview <br>
2. The analysis part that aims at 1) deriving an equation that can serve as a good approximation of the relationship between the variation of Te and the variations of $`\rho`$, $`Pg`$, and $`B^{2}`$ (completed; see the derived equation on P18 of `On Funnel Wall Variability-vis and analysis`);
   2) finding out which quantity's variation is the dominant one in what range (in progress; building a clustering model)
